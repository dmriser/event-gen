# event-gen
Here you can find several event generators that were used in CLAS.  Some of them have had LUND output crudely added to them.  I didn't write the source code of any of them.

- The SConstruct file compiles each generator
- They can be run with: gen_name < input_file.dat
- There are testing scripts in each folder
